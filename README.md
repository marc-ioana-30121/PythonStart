# My Python Projects

Welcome to my Python projects repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that I am working on as I learn and grow my programming skills.
Each project focuses on a specific concept or problem, helping me explore Python's powerful features and build a strong foundation in coding.

## Projects Included:
-> Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Docker support: A simple implementation of the classic game
-> War: Python implementation with OOP design, of the classic card game "War", where two players compete by drawing cards from their decks. 
-> simple shell (command-line interpreter).
-> OOP basic: Bank Account system implemented using Object-Oriented Programming.


## Goals
Learn the fundamentals of Python programming.
Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
Experiment with Python's standard libraries and external tools.
Share my progress and receive feedback from others.

##### Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or even contribute suggestions!
